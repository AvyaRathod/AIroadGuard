            Road accidents continue to be a leading cause of death, disabilities
            and hospitalization in the country despite our commitment and
            efforts. India ranks first in the number of road accident deaths
            across the 199 countries and accounts for almost 11% of the accident
            related deaths in the World. We aim to make emergency services work
            easier and efficient with the use of Machine Learning and
            technology.
            <br />
            AI.roadGuard can be deployed as a smart system of devices, It uses
            Machine Learning and Deep Learning models like convolutional neural
            networks to predict actual time accidents using CCTV footage and
            inform the emergency services about the mishappening.
